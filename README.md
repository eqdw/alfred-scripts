# alfred-scripts


NOTE: this script expects a file named 'urls.rb'. Urls should
define a class Github::Urls that contains a class method
lookup that maps shortcut symbols (specified in alfred)
into github repo urls. This file is included in the .gitignore.

This is to keep the urls of repos private.
